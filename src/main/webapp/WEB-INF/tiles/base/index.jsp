		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>QoDisco is a QoC-aware resource discovery service for IoT
				structured upon a distributed architecture composed of autonomous
				repositories that store resource descriptions and QoC- related
				information. QoDisco provides an API to perform discovery tasks in
				such repositories and it complies with important requirements for
				discovering resources in the IoT context, e.g., multi-attribute and
				range queries, and both synchronous and asynchronous operations.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, QoDisco encompasses an ontology-based information
				model with a consistent vocabulary of concepts related to resources
				and services, relationships among them, and QoC information. This
				information model takes advantage of well-established, standardized
				ontologies to semantically describe resources and services, namely
				the Semantic Actuator Network (SAN) ontology, the Semantic Sensor
				Network (SSN) ontology, and the Ontology Web Language for Services
				(OWL-S). In addition, we have incorporated part of the Quality of
				Context Information Meta-model (QoCIM) to our information model
				aiming at dealing with QoC requirements in the search procedure.</p>
