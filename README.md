# QoDisco
QoDisco is a QoC-aware resource discovery service for IoT structured upon a distributed architecture composed of autonomous repositories that store resource descriptions and QoC-related information. QoDisco provides an API to perform discovery tasks in such repositories and it complies with important requirements for discovering resources in the IoT context, e.g., multi-attribute and range queries, and both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
